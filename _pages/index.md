Welcome to my blogfolio! I am a second year at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo studying business administration with a concentration in marketing. My passions include writing (hence, the blog), hiking, and crafting my dream life through Pinterest boards.

I created AttaGirlAsh to remind, inspire, and invigorate college students to be the best version of themselves, cultivate healthy habits from a young age, and dance like nobody is watching.
