Welcome to my blogfolio! I recently graduated from Cal Poly SLO with a degree in marketing and minor in integrated marketing communications. My passions include writing (hence, the blog), hiking, and crafting my dream life through Pinterest boards.

I started AttaGirlAsh to have a creative outlet, document moments of inspiration, and challenge myself as a non-STEM major to learn the basics of web development.
