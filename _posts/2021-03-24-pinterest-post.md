We’ve all been there. Endlessly scrolling on social media only to find ourselves comparing, doubting, and questioning ourselves. Or maybe you’ve stalked your own feed and felt like an imposter. Abs? Flexing. Skin? Good lighting. Smile? Forced. Either way, modern use of social media is set up as a basis of comparison to the other girl.

## The “Other Girl’s” Profile

Let me introduce you to the other girls, shall we? Don’t worry, they don’t bite.

### Facebook

This girl likes to reminisce on the good ol’ times. She stays in touch with childhood friends from preschool and cousins who live on the other side of the country. She loves meeting new people, but her social battery can run out quickly. Also, know that if the “Cupid Shuffle” plays in any public setting, she is morally obligated to dance along. When she is not dancing like no one is watching, she is up at 6am tucking a collared shirt into her favorite pair of skinny jeans and lacing up low-rise converse for her hip job in the Bay Area. 

### Snapchat

Like Facebook, Snapchat is a social butterfly. She was well-known in high school and had a lot of friends, although sometimes they didn’t always have her back. She keeps up with the trends, wearing Nike Air Force Ones and drinking Yerba Mate’s on the daily. She has neck problems from being on her phone all day and will probably tell you she “is literally dead” because of it (but, obviously, she’s not).

### Instagram

You can find Instagram at Target in baggy sweatpants, fuzzy socks, and a messy bun on Sunday nights. On Mondays, she watches The Bachelor with her BFFs eating a pint of Ben and Jerry’s. By Tuesday, she has already read the spoilers on <https://realitysteve.com>. Don’t be surprised if she never shows emotion - she uses sarcasm as a coping mechanism. So, when she says “Dude, I can’t even,” she probably can even, whatever that means!

### YouTube

Introducing, YouTube. She has a lot of guy friends who are secretly in love with her and is considered a “guy’s girl.” She’s too busy playing sports to be in a relationship in the first place and would rather watch videos of Emma Chamberlain in her free time. Her favorite saying is “here for a good time not a long time,” so catch her on every rollercoaster at Great America or cliff-jumping in Tahoe.

## The Downfall 

The other girls are tough shells to crack. They are hard to get to know and don’t open up to just anybody. Insecure behind closed doors, yet confident in front of a crowd, these girls set false standards for the little sisters of the world. Although it may not be intentional, the other girls basically coined the term FOMO (fear of missing out). They can get so caught up in their own lives they forget to invite the new girl to sit with them at lunch.

### Pinterest 

Pinterest is the girl who lights up every room she walks into. In her own room, she has a quote jar on her desk and thrifted overalls hanging up in the closet. She snorts when she laughs but most people find it endearing. When you are having a midlife crisis, she is there to remind you “you’re going to kill it.” 

Her goal as a young girl was simple: to be useful. Since then, her mission has evolved into **bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.** She will encourage you to manifest anything from that one story fixer upper on the country side to the rose tattoo you’ve been wanting (don’t worry, she’s good at keeping secrets if you want to hide certain dreams from your dad).

So, is it wrong to be like the other girls? No! All girls should support other girls, and Pinterest is just the place to do that.
