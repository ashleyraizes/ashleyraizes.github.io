We’ve all been there. Endlessly scrolling on social media only to find ourselves comparing, doubting, and questioning ourselves. Or maybe you’ve stalked your own feed and felt like an imposter. Abs? Flexing. Skin? Good lighting. Smile? Forced. Either way, modern use of social media is set up as a basis of comparison to the other girl.

## The “Other Girl’s” Profile

Let me introduce you to the other girls, shall we? Don’t worry, they don’t bite.

### Facebook

This girl likes to reminisce on the good ol’ times. She stays in touch with childhood friends from preschool and cousins who live on the other side of the country. She loves meeting new people, but her social battery can run out quickly. Also, know that if the “Cupid Shuffle” plays in any public setting, she is morally obligated to dance along. When she is not dancing like no one is watching, she is up at 6am tucking a collared shirt into her favorite pair of skinny jeans and lacing up low-rise converse for her hip job in the Bay Area. 

### Snapchat
