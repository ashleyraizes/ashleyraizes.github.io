This smoothie-shake hybrid is an absolute staple in my diet. You can even change up the nut butters and milk of your choice to add your own twist. 

Ingredients:

* 1 frozen banana (frozen bananas are key for a thick, creamy consistency)
* 1 scoop Vega Chocolate plant-based protein (can also use cocoa powder or nutella)
* ½ cup oat milk (can use almond, cashew, soy, you name it)
* 1 scoop of peanut butter 
* 2 tbsp chia seeds 
* Add honey or dates if you want it extra sweet
* ½ avocado (makes it extra velvety)
* 1 serving  of plant-based yogurt (I recommend Trader Joes vanilla bean cashewmilk)

Throw into blender, top with chocolate chips or oats, and enjoy!
