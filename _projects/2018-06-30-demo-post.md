This smoothie-shake hybrid is an absolute staple in my diet. You can even change up the nut butters and add your milk of choice for a twist.  

Ingredients:

* 1 frozen banana (frozen bananas are key for a thick, creamy consistency)
* 1 scoop Vega chocolate plant-based protein (can also use cocoa powder or nutella)
* Â½ cup oat milk (can use almond, cashew, soy, you name it)
* 1 scoop of peanut butter 
* 1 serving of plant-based yogurt (I recommend Trader Joes vanilla bean cashewmilk)
* 2 tbsp chia seeds 
* 1/2 avocado (for a velvety texture)
* Add honey or dates to make it extra sweet

Throw into blender, top with chocolate chips or oats, and enjoy!
